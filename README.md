# Holiday Planner Agent

## Setup

Ensure you're using Python 3.11 or later.

Launch your `anaconda_prompt` cmd line from Anaconda Navigator and create your environment with `conda create --name myenv` then `conda install jupyter`.<br>
Python libraries that need to be install are set in the first part `.ipynb` Notebook.

## Scope
In this project we will go through the LangChain project of building a Customer Support Bot.<br> 
Basically the result of this project is a fully Agent that can help people plan holidays from booking flights to plan an escursions.
I think that company and enterpreneurs needed a real case of using an Agent to understand better the opportunities of this technology.<br>
And honestly me too, weren't we a bit tired of building RAG applications, I mean, no?<br>

We'll propose three different types of Agent architectures:
* Zero-shot Agent
* Add Confirmation - Human-in-the-loop
* Conditional Interrupt - Human-in-the-loop
* Specialized Workflow - Multi-agent supervisor<br>


Every architecture described has its pros and cons but each of it helps us to great the same solution.
